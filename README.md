## What is this ?
This is a simple World of Warcraft 1.12 addon I created to automate certain tasks.
Feel free to use and modify it as needed, but keep in mind it's primarily for personal use, so it's not guaranteed to be fully optimized or error-free.

## Instruction
Check the EasyMode.lua file for specific instructions on creating in-game macros to use with this addon.

## What else ?
Another good addon to use with this addon is SuperMacro.
(https://github.com/Monteo/SuperMacro)
It will help get the right icon with tooltip for the macro.
