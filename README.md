## What is this ?
This is a simple <B>World of Warcraft 1.12</B> addon I created to automate certain tasks.<br>
Feel free to use and modify it as needed, but keep in mind it's primarily for personal use, so it's not guaranteed to be fully optimized or error-free.

## Instruction
Check the ProSlacker.lua file for specific instructions on creating in-game macros to use with this addon.<br>
Example:<br>
/run -- CastSpellByName("Sinister Strike")<br>
/script RogueAttack()<br>

## What else ?
Another good addon to use with this addon is SuperMacro.<br>
https://github.com/Monteo/SuperMacro <br>
It will help get the right icon with tooltip for the macro.
